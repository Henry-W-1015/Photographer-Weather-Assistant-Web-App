Windows:

cd into Photographer-Weather-Assistant-Web-App and setup the virtual environment with:

py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate (You must run this command everytime you want to edit this project)

Windows may give you an error, start a powershell as administrator and run the following

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
This allows you to run scripts that you've downloaded off the internet (like the activation script)

Finally install the necessary modules inside the virtual environment
pip install flask
pip install python-weather
pip install flask[async]
pip install flask-cors

To run the server, make sure venv is activated,
cd into the server directory
flask --app index.py run
